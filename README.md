# Rootcode Tech-Triathlon
Team Enigmas project for root code tech triathlon competition.

The competion consists of 3 phases namely designathon, hackathon and datathon. 

## 1. Desinathon Phase
In this phase we designed the UI for our applicationa and defined the functionality of the application. Since the challenge is based on mobile first approach, we first design the UI/UX for android application.
