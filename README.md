The competition consists of 3 phases namely designathon, hackathon, and datathon. 

## 1. Designathon Phase
In this phase, we designed the UI for our application and defined the functionality of the application. Since the challenge is based on a mobile-first approach, we first design the UI/UX for the Android application.

Also, you can experience the app from [Figma prototyping](https://www.figma.com/proto/c4jeNTKah5YzlCkpKbV2HN/Enigmas_SpireX_Design?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=113-2278&viewport=358%2C105%2C0.15&t=LZZcJF1GeCYvsKxT-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design)

## 2. Hackathon Phase
In this phase, we developed our Android App according to our plan in the designathon phase. We managed to implement exactly as we planned in designathon phase.

## 3. Datathon Phase
This phase didn't have a direct relation with the first and second phases. In this phase, we had to develop an AI model for identifying different tumors. We developed a CNN for this and we managed to get 89% accuracy of our model. Here We had to identify tumors belonging to three categories and also identify cases with no tumor case.
